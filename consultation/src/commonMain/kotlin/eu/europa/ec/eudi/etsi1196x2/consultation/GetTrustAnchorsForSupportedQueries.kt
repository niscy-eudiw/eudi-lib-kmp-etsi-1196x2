/**
 * A composite source for retrieving trust anchors, specialized for handling a predefined set of supported queries.
 *
 * Unlike a simple [GetTrustAnchors] that may attempt to resolve any given query (possibly through a sequential
 * search of multiple backends), this component maintains an explicit [mapping][sources] between sets of supported queries
 * and their respective providers. This allows for:
 * - **Efficient Routing**: Invocations are directly routed to the appropriate provider based on the query.
 * - **Explicit Capability**: The component knows exactly which queries it can satisfy, returning a clear
 *   indication when a query is not supported.
 * - **Strict Invariants**: It ensures that each query is handled by at most one [GetTrustAnchors], preventing
 *   ambiguous or overlapping definitions.
 *
 * [combining][plus] multiple instances is only allowed if their supported query sets are disjoint (**Exclusivity**).
 *
 * Note: This class owns the lifecycle of its underlying sources.
 * When this instance is closed, all internal sources that implement [AutoCloseable] will also be closed.
 *
 * @param QUERY the type of the query
 * @param TRUST_ANCHOR the type of the trust anchors returned by the source
