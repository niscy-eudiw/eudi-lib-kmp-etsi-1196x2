 * A functional source for retrieving trust anchors from a trusted provider based on a specific query.

 *
 * This source can be:
 * - **Combined**: Using the [or] operator to chain multiple sources together.
 * - **Transformed**: Using [contraMap] to adapt the query type to a different dialect.
 * - **Cached**: Using [cached] to improve performance by storing previously retrieved results.
 *
